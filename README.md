### Extra security; wp-config.php  set the file rigts to: 444.
Insert AFTER: require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');
ini_set('display_errors','Off');
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL );
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT',true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS',true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT',true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS',true);






Set: robots.txt: 444
